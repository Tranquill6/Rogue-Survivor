This is the latest version of roguedjack's game Rogue Survivor, I would have just forked it, but he did not upload the latest version of his source code onto GitHub. He even said directly on one of his repos, containing an older version of the source code, to download it from his blog.

I plan on expanding this game for fun to learn C#.
